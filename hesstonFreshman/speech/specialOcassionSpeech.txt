I would like to intrduce you all to Joseph A. Manickam, president of Hesston College. He grew up in a family with a deep connection to God and the church
he was born in Thailand, the youngest in a family of 6, later came to the United States for highschool where he went to Hoover Highschool in North Canton,
he then came to Hesston College, where he first came into contact with the mennonite perspective on life, as well as many of their beliefs
later he went to Goshen colllege to finish his Bachelors degree, only to return to Hesston College to work for admissions
He then left to go to Fuller College as well as attend Pasadena Mennonite Church, a small Mennonite church, in which I grew up in, which is one that many
of Fullers Mennonite students go to, as well as many of PMC's members end up going to fuller seminary.
