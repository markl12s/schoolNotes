1) Leadership
	we never officially chose one, but star took up that role
	I think we both did well about equally at doing the work

2) responsibilities
	I believe we were both fully committed, and did well in the assignment
	both of us did the work that we were designated for
	there was no conflict in the group
	
3) use of reflective thinking method
	We did define the question well, as well as what defined a good solution

	I think we analyzed the problem fairly well, but maybe we could have done a better
	job of understanding the problem itself, like the use of breaks is different for 
	different needs, like with ADHD more shorter breaks is often better, often using
	what is known as the Pomodoro technique 25 minutes of work, 5 minute break, atleast
	for tasks that are harder to focus on, 
	but they can also have what's known as "hyperfocus" where you can focus far longer
	and easier than others, often to the point where you forget to eat, on the otherhand
	many other people find that taking breaks can 

	I think we did a fairly good job aat identifying potential solutions, then narrowing
	it down to just the more useful ones

4) overall analysis
	I am satisfied with the work that we did
	
	if the group were to start over Id have tried to be more organized, as to avoid doing 
	unnecisary things
