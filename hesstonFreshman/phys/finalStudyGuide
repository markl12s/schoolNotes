	B) steps of it
		I) ask a question
			a) something you are trying to figure out the answer to
				1) could be a simple boolean question, like "is this true?", or a more complex "why does this happen?"

			a) stand on the shoulder of giants
		III) construct a hypothesis
			a) guess about how things work/answer to your question
		IV) test your hypothesis
			a) run an expieriment
				1) controlled expieriment

		V) analyze your data and draw a conclusion
			a) once expierinment is concluded write up your results
				1) not always conclusive
		VI) communicate your results
			a) release a report

3) the periodic table
	A) created by Dmitri Mendeleev, a russian chemist
	B) reading the periodic table
		I) atomic number
			a) number of protons in an atoms nucleas
		II) atomic symbol
			a) the one or two letters that describe an element
				1) for example "O" for oxygen
					A) this allows you to localize the names of the element and have an international term as well
		III) atomic mass
			a) standard atomic weight
			b) generally a floating point/decimal number
				1) because it's a weighted average of the isotopes
	C) how it's designed
		I) atomic weight and valence electrons
			a) each element has a row (period) and column (group)
				1) seven periods, 18 groupsa

4) seperation of mixtures
	A) different mixtures can be used to seperate mixtures
		I) handpicking
			a) picking out all unwanted substances by hand
				1) generally relatively large objects
		II) sieving
			a) seperate mixtures between different sizes
				1) goes through a colander
		III) evaporation
			a) seperating a mixture
				1) mixture is heated until one evaporates and leaves the other liquid
		IV) distilation
			a) vaporized condensed and isolated
			b) mixture is vaporized condensed and then isolated
		V) filteration or sedimentation
			a) remove solid particles from water
				1) use a funnel
		VI) seperating funnel
			a) unequal density in particles
				1) split between top and bottom
				2) oil and water for example
		VII) magnetic seperation
			a) when one substance has magnetic properties you can use a magnet

5) the hubble space telescope
	A) a big telescope sent into space by NASA for scientific research
		I) launched on april 24th 1990 from the space shuttle discovery

6) Apollo Guidance System (AGC) 
	A) In July 16, 1969
	B) sent on the Saturn V rocket
		I) from engines fired to in orbit is 12 minutes
		II) final landing with only 30 seconds worth of fuel to spare
			a) armstrong was most worried about the landing "there were just a million things to worry about"
	C) the saturn 5
		I) first unmanned test flight was in 1967
		II) at first it carries 203,400 gallons of fuel
			a) at 42 miles the F-1 engines shut down and are dropped into the ocean because they are dead weight
				1) 340,000 gallons of fuel are left
	D) appollo guidance computer
		I) development of it was led by Margaret Hamilton
			a) 350 total people involved
			b) at one point a hardware problem came up due to human error in flight
			c) predominatlely self driving
				1) according to David Mindell "the story of human prowess is almost a perfect reversal of reality"
		II) only had 72 kilobytes of memory
			a) for perspective a pregnancy test has 64 kilobytes
		III) built ontop polaris guided-missile system
			a) used for nuclear weapons
		IV) one of the first computers to support multitasking as well as early User interface
			a) only reason it could land due to the hardware malfunction, as the hardware was giving bad isntructions, but they were deemed low priority
				1) this is why I don't trust humans
		V) written in AGC (appollo guidance computer) assembly language
			a) it was an interpreted language, meaning the computer would interpret what was written in operation instead of compiling it all beforehand
				1) interpreted on a virtual machine that was dedicated to interpreting the code
					A) despite the fact that interpreted languages are generally slower especially before Just in time compling
	E) Hamilton popularized the term "software engineering"
		I) which is the term for using the principles of engineering in design, development and maintenance of software
		II) her code was written on punch cards
