on July 16, 1969 the saturn 5 was launched into space to go to the moon

sent on the sataurn V rocket, the first unmanned test flight was in 1967

one of the most important part of the moon landing was the apollo guidance computer. 
The computer ran on 72 kilobytes of memory, for some perspective a modern pregnancy test has around 64 KB
The project was run by Margaret Hamilton, but had 350 total people involved in it's development
it was predominately self driving David Mindell describes it as
"the story of human prowess is almost a complete reversal of reality", 
yet somehow the astronauts still managed to screw it up. proving the superiority of automated systems, as manually controlled should be left to toys, not useful systems.
A human error caused some significant problems, during landing sending bad instructions, but due to
J. Halcombe Lanings triage system for it's instructions it deemed that these were unimportant and 
continued with normal landing

It was written In a language created for it called appollo guidance system assembly language, an
which was an interpreted language, the interpreting was done through a VM that was dedicated to
interpreteting. This was done despite the fact that at this time the gap in speed between 
interpreted and compiled languages was enormas as Just in Time compiling is much more recent

So in conclusion, while we went to the moon with a self driving pregnancy test in 1967, yet people are still scared of self driving cars
