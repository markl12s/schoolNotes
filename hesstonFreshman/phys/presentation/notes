1) In July 16, 1969
2) sent on the Saturn V rocket
	A) from engines fired to in orbit is 12 minutes
	B) final landing with only 30 seconds worth of fuel to spare
		I) armstrong was most worried about the landing "there were just a million things to worry about"
3) the saturn 5
	A) first unmanned test flight was in 1967
	B) at first it carries 203,400 gallons of fuel
		I) at 42 miles the F-1 engines shut down and are dropped into the ocean because they are dead weight
			a) 340,000 gallons of fuel are left

4) appollo guidance computer
	A) development of it was led by Margaret Hamilton
		I) 350 total people involved
		II) at one point a hardware problem came up due to human error in flight
		III) predominatlely self driving
			a) according to David Mindell "the story of human prowess is almost a perfect reversal of reality"
	B) only had 72 kilobytes of memory
		I) for perspective a pregnancy test has 64 kilobytes
	C) built ontop polaris guided-missile system
		I) used for nuclear weapons
	D) one of the first computers to support multitasking as well as early User interface
	E) J. Halcombe Laning designed a triage syste for it's tasks
		I) only reason it could land due to the hardware malfunction, as the hardware was giving bad isntructions, but they were deemed low priority
			a) this is why I don't trust humans
	F) written in AGC (appollo guidance computer) assembly language\
		I) it was an interpreted language, meaning the computer would interpret what was written in operation instead of compiling it all beforehand
			a) interpreted on a virtual machine that was dedicated to interpreting the code
				1) despite the fact that interpreted languages are generally slower especially before Just in time compling, which is the only real reason modern interpreted languages like python, is usable

5) Hamilton popularized the term "software engineering"
	A) her code was written on punch cards
