1) quiz on mymathlab
	A) very similar to the test
		I) so if you can do the test you can do the quiz
			a) due tomorrow night

QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS AND THEIR PROPERTIES
2) f(x) = x ^ 2
	A) basic function
3) f(x) = 2x^2
	A) vertical stretch by two
4) f(x)  = 2(x - 1) ^ 2
	A) right by 1
5) f(x)  = 2(x - 1) ^ 2 - 3
	A) down by 3
	B) so the full transformation is stretch by 2, right by 1, down by 3

6) verticalStretch * sqrt(x + leftMovement)^2 + upMovement

7) standard form of quadratic function
	A) f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c where a != 0
	B) if a > 0 parabola opens up
		I) towards positive infinity
	C) if a < 0 parabola opens down
		I) towards negative infinity
	D) h = -(-b/2a) and k = f(h)
		I) coordinates of the vertex
		II) x = h; y = k
	E) to find the intercepts
		I) y intercept
			a) x(0)
		II) x intercept
			a) ax^2 + bx + c

8) look up axis of symetry, don't fully understand that

9) various properties of a graph
	A) domain
		I) x's in the graph
	B) range
		I) Y's in the graph
	C) increasing
		I) where it goes up/left to right
	D) decreasing
		I) where it goes down/right to left

10) f(x) = 3x^2 -24x + 53
	if (k opens up)
		minimum of function = k
		no maxiumum
	else if (k opens down)
		no minimum of function
		maximum of function = k

	D) formula to find minimum of function
		A) x = -(-b/2a)

INEQUALITIES INVOLVING QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS
11) to solve inequalities involving quadratic functions
	A) find the x-intercepts
	B) determine if the parabola opens up or down
	C) graph the parabola
		I) graph the parabola, using x-intercepts and the fact that the parabola opens up or down
	D) select the intervals that form the solution set

12) if two equations, put all of it on one side and put 0 on the other
	A) 2x^2 + 2x + 3 > x^2 - 2x + 8
		I) x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS
13) definition of polynomial function
	A) functiion in the form an * x ^ n + an-1 x ^ n-1 + etc
	B) leading term, largest exponent
		I) leading coefficent, the number before the variable in the leading term
			a) i.e 5x^2 leading term is 5
	C) this is basically just big O notation for analyzing algorithms
		I) the degree is the speed in big O notation

14) if multiplicity of a zero is odd, then the graph of the polynomial crosses the x-axis, then graph of
	the polynomial crosses, the axis. and if the multiplicity of a zero is even, then graph of the polynomial
	touches the x-axis at that point

MISC NOTES
15) sqrt of a number can be positive or negative
	A) sqrt(4) = 2, -2
		I) opposite of the positive number

16) for origin symetry see if you can swap x and y and get the same function
	A) if no Y-axis symetry

17) work on symetry of a graph
