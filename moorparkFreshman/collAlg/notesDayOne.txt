1) Hybrid class
	A) 7 hours a week  online "In class"
		I) more time other

2) 27 sections
	A) not much will be the last week
		I) as it will be for final preparations
	B) about 9 sections in a week
		I) 5-6 in class, the rest online

3) sullivan 11th editon
	A) buy online version
		I) most important part is the access code
	B) buy directly from pierson, it's faster/easier and same price

4) simple scientific calculators are allowed
	A) no graphing calculators

5) 2 midterms exams, and a final

LINEAR EQUATIONS
6) put vars on one side, numbers on other
	A) try writing a linear function calculator
		I) afterwards maybe generalize to quadratics as well

QUADRATIC EQUATIONS
7) solve by factoring
	A) find numbers (n and m) that add to the b and multipy for the c for ax^2 + bx + c
		I) (3x - n) (x + m)

8) square root method
	A) x^2 - 4 = 0
		I) move 4 to the right
			a) x^2 = -4

9) completing the square method
	A) more generalized solution
		I) harder, so probably work on this more, since it works for everything, so I can use just it
	B) add a number to get a complete square
	C) apply square root property
	D) solutions = [sqrt(14) - 2, sqrt(-14) - 2]
	E) x^2 - 10x + 2 = 0

10) quadratic formula
	A) solutions to quadratic equation
		I) learn it
		II) seperately do the b^2 - 4ac

11) email professor about wrong code in sylabus
