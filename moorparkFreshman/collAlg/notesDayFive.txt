COMPOSITE FUNCTIONS
1) FoG(x)
	A) same as F(G(x))
	B) pipelines functions together
		I) n = G(x) || F(n)

2) domain of function
	A) inputs that don't break the function

3) requirment of function
	A) one input == one output
	B) one to one function
		I) no repeating outputs
		II) example
			a) f(x) = sqrt(x)
		III) domain of function = inverse of function
	C) to find inverse of function given by a graph, find the graph symetric to the line y=x
		I) the graphs of a function and its inverse are symetric with respect to the line y=x

4) find the inverse
	A) F^-1
		I) inverse of the function

5) eulers number
	A) (1 + 1/inf)^inf

6) replace the computers battery
	A) it keeps running out, dies mid class, can't get much time out of lowering brightness
