5.1
1) end behavior
	A) x and y go to infinity or negative infinity depending on the sector of the graph
		I) the graph goes to different sections depending on the function in use

2) end behavior for y = x^2
	A) both up/a U like shape
3) end behavior for y = -x^2
	A) the opposite of y=x^2
		I) both down, similar to the intersection symbol
4) y = x^3
	A) down and up
		I) sort of like a  lightning bolt
5) y = -x^3
	A) reflection of x^3

6) the negative sign reflects the graph

7) the end behavior of even degree polynomial is similar to end behavior of x^2 or -x^2
8) odd degree polynomials will be similar to x^3 or -x^3

9) sign of the leading term
	A) if the leading term is negative it reflects the end behavior
	B) if positive
		I) if even
			a) trends towards (inf, inf)
		II) if odd
			a) trends towards (-inf, inf)
	C) if negative
		I) if even
			a) trends towards (-inf, -inf)
		II) if odd
			a) trends towards (inf, -inf)

GRAPH A POLYNOMIAL
10) to graph a polynomial
	A) find y-intercepts
		I) plug 0 in for x
	B) find the x-intercepts
	C) determine if graph crosses/touches x-axis
		I) use multiplicities
			a) even or odd
	D) determine the end behavior
	E) graph
		I) imprecise

RATIONAL FUNCTIONS
11) horizontal asymtotes
	A) if degree of numberator < degree denominator
		I) y=0 (x-axis) is the horizonatal asymptote
	B) if degree of numberator == degree denominator
		I) leading coeficient of numerator / leading coefficient of the denominator
			a) is the leading coeffiecient
	C) if degree of numberator == degree denominator + 1
		I) then asymptote is oblique

12) vertical asymtotes
	A) to find vertical asymptotes, first find zeros of denominator
